                <p><strong>By Emily Keller-O'Donnell</strong></p>
                <p class="date">July 25, 2023</p>
                <p> As the start of the 2023-2024 school year approaches, understanding the seismic risk level of K-12 schools in earthquake-prone Washington State is a complex challenge.
                </p>
                <p> At a recent visit to my local elementary school, a longtime administrator was unsure about whether the school had received a seismic retrofitting. The school was originally constructed in 1952, long before seismic standards were modernized in the 1990s. I was advised to contact the district for an answer. I began to research data across the state for a journalism project at the <a href="https://ledeprogram.com/">Lede Program</a>. I found that there are multiple state initiatives underway to improve tracking and fund construction and renovation at high risk schools, but that the availability and interpretability of this data remains limited and confusing.
                </p>
                <h3><strong>Statewide Efforts to Improve Data Collection and Upgrade Buildings</strong></h3>
                <p>
                From 2017-2021, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources led the <a href="https://www.dnr.wa.gov/school-seismic-safety">School Seismic Safety Project (SSSP)</a>, with $3.4 million in state funding, to conduct geological and engineering assessments of 561 public school buildings at 339 schools. The <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dnr/geologydata/school_seismic_safety/phase2/School_Seismic_Safety_Project_2021_Final_Report_DNR.pdf">final report</a> identified more than 80 "very high" risk buildings and more than 270 "high" risk buildings across the state. I examined this data by scraping a 47-page PDF chart from the final report, which identified schools by their names and districts but did not provide addresses. Then I manually matched the majority of these schools with addresses from the <a href="https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/23bbd746f9924c149681815cfd2a6300/explore?location=47.266088%2C-120.802250%2C7.02&showTable=true">Washington Geospatial Open Data Portal</a> to create a <a href="https://efkodon.github.io/wa-schools-seismic/">map</a>, due to variations in how school names are recorded. Ten buildings could not be reliably matched and were omitted from the analysis. The assessments represented about 14 percent of the state's more than 4,000 public school buildings for grades K-12 that are listed in the open data portal. None of the 18 schools in my district were included. Private schools were also excluded.
                </p>
                In 2022, the Washington State legislature <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5933&Year=2021">passed a bill</a> establishing the <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/sites/default/files/public/communications/2022docs/C9-School-Seismic-Safety-Grant-Program.pdf">School Seismic Safety program</a> to provide planning and construction funds for K-12 public schools to retrofit or relocate their buildings for better protection against earthquakes and tsunamis. The program is expected to provide $500 million to schools via grant applications from 2023-2033. However, the SSSP final report estimates that upgrading all public schools would cost billions of dollars.

                <br>
                <p>In June 2021, the SSSP final report called for the creation of a statewide inventory of school districts to collect data about which facilities have had seismic upgrades. Two years later, that effort is well underway. A public records request to the <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/">Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI)</a> yielded a 6,503 row spreadsheet representing individual "building areas" at 1,802 public schools. Fields include year built, construction type, retrofit status, soil type, risk level, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-liquefaction#:~:text=Liquefaction%20takes%20place%20when%20loosely,cause%20major%20damage%20during%20earthquakes.">liquefaction</a>, and more. There were 197 schools rated "very high" risk, of which 17 have been retroffited; and 69 schools rated "high" risk, of which four have been retrofitted. In my local district, none of the seven “very high" or “high" risk schools have been retrofitted, although several others were recently rebuilt. In addition, the risk level is missing for 63 percent of the building areas listed. 
                </p>
                <p>As this data collection is ongoing, there are fields with missing data, as well as historial (outdated) data for buildings that have since been replaced. (A small number of schools listed as "old" were excluded from the analysis). While OSPI has been responsive to my requests, this static version of the dataset will become outdated, with no public version currently available to check for updates. Facility data is not included in the <a href="https://washingtonstatereportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/">Washington School Report Card</a>, which is often used to research individual public schools, with information about enrollment, teacher qualifications, student performance, expenditures per student, and more. (It is also unclear why the schools in my district are listed as “rural” in the OSPI data when they are located in a city).
                </p>
                <h3>What is an Unreinforced Masonry Building?</h3>
                <p>The SSSP final report notes that buildings made with unreinforced masonry (URM) before the 1940s, and non-ductile concrete buildings (without seismic upgrades) constructed before the mid-1970s, face the highest risk of collapse in an earthquake. Secondarily, buildings constructed prior to 1975 out of reinforced masonry and wood frame materials are also vulnerable to collapse. I look back at my data to examine the presence of URM construction in public school buildings.
                </p>
                <p>The dangers posed by URM buildings in an earthquake have been in the news for years, although identifying these buildings with precision remains challenging. Buildings constructed with unreinforced masonry can be identified via an observable <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/hazards/unreinforced-masonry-buildings-(urm)-">brick pattern</a> with a narrow brick width every 5-6 rows, and by low or flat arched windows, historical records, and on-site assessments. The buildings <a href="https://www.commerce.wa.gov/programs/research-services/unreinforced-masonry-building-inventory/">may be constructed</a> with red bricks or sometimes clay tiles. However, there are numerous “suspected” rather than confirmed URMs due to this complex identification process.
                </p>
                <p>In 2018, the Washington State Department of Commerce <a href="https://www.commerce.wa.gov/programs/research-services/unreinforced-masonry-building-inventory/">announced</a> plans to create an inventory of URM buildings. According to the announcement, the study identified 1,176 confirmed URM buildings, including 219 school facilities (both public and private). The public release of the URM database received a wave of press coverage, but in 2023, the original <a href="http://www.gartrellgroup.net/WashURMViewer/#7/47.347/-121.029/">database link</a> provided in the media reports no longer works. The database, now known as the Washington URM Dashboard, can now be found <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/com/urmasonary/urmasonary/#7/47.347/-121.029/">here</a>.

                  </div>
                </p>
                <p>Exploring the Washington URM Dashboard yields the following findings: Clicking on “Schools” from the announcement page loads a <a href="https://deptofcommerce.app.box.com/v/wa-urm-schools">short PDF</a> that breaks the 219 school facilities into 76 identified URMs and 143 “identified or suspected URM buildings”; not the 219 “confirmed” URMs originally announced. Searching the dashboard for “identified URMs” that are schools yields 76 results (including 34 public schools), which are part of a total of 218 “identified or suspected URMs”. There appears to be no option to download the data. Schools on the map are identified by their address, but many of the school names are missing. There is no keyword search box to look for properties by name, so it appears that the only way to search the map is by zooming into known addresses. 
                </p>
                <p>Looking at the OSPI data about the seismic risk and retrofit status of public schools shows three construction types that include some type of URM: <i>URM bearing walls</i>, and concrete or steel frames with <i>URM infill walls</i>. There are 134 public schools with at least one of these construction types listed (including at least one school that is currently being rebuilt). 
                </p>
                  <div class="image">
                      <img src="images/brick1.jpg" alt="the side of a building made of red brick">
                  </div>
                <br>
                <p>My local elementary school has a “very high” risk rating in the OSPI data, with two out of six building areas having “concrete frame buildings with URM infill walls”. This marks an increase from the school’s “high” risk listed in the district's Pre-Hazard Mitigation Plan. Five of the six building areas are labeled as the “main area” of the “main building,” without differentiation about where they sit in physical space. Are these common areas of classrooms? Which grades are affected? So I drive over to look for the characteristic brick pattern that can be used to identify URM buildings. I don’t see it. Phew. I snap some pictures. I drive home. Then I look more closely. I think I do see it. But my local school is not among the 34 public schools in the Washington URM Dashboard, creating more uncertainty. 
                </p>
                <p>In the coming weeks, I plan to further investigate these issues and seek answers to some of the areas of confusion noted above. For more information on this project, visit the <a href="https://github.com/efkodon/schools_data_access">Github repository</a>.
