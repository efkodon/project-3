                <p><strong>By Emily Keller-O'Donnell</strong></p>
                <p class="date">July 25, 2023</p>
                <p> As the start of the 2023-2024 school year approaches, understanding the seismic risk level of K-12 schools in earthquake-prone Washington State is a complex challenge.
                </p>
                <p> At a recent visit to my local elementary school, a longtime administrator was unsure about whether the school had received a seismic retrofitting. The school was originally constructed in 1952, long before seismic standards were modernized in the 1990s. I was advised to contact the district for an answer. I began to research data across the state for a journalism project at the <a href="https://ledeprogram.com/">Lede Program</a>. I found that there are multiple state initiatives underway to improve tracking and fund construction and renovation at high risk schools, but that the availability and interpretability of this data remains limited and confusing.
                </p>
                <h3><strong>Statewide Efforts to Improve Data Collection and Upgrade Buildings</strong></h3>
                <p>
                From 2017-2021, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources led the <a href="https://www.dnr.wa.gov/school-seismic-safety">School Seismic Safety Project (SSSP)</a>, with $3.4 million in state funding, to conduct geological and engineering assessments of 561 public school buildings at 339 schools. The <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dnr/geologydata/school_seismic_safety/phase2/School_Seismic_Safety_Project_2021_Final_Report_DNR.pdf">final report</a> identified more than 80 "very high" risk buildings and more than 270 "high" risk buildings. I examined this data by scraping a 47-page PDF chart from the final report, which identified schools by their names and districts but did not provide addresses. Then I manually matched the majority of these schools with addresses from the <a href="https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/23bbd746f9924c149681815cfd2a6300/explore?location=47.266088%2C-120.802250%2C7.02&showTable=true">Washington Geospatial Open Data Portal</a>, due to variations in how school names are recorded, to create a <a href="https://efkodon.github.io/wa-schools-seismic/">map</a>. Ten buildings could not be reliably matched and were omitted from the analysis. The assessments represented about 14 percent of the state's more than 4,000 public school buildings for grades K-12 that are listed in the open data portal. None of the 18 schools in my district were included. Private schools were also excluded.
                </p>
                In 2022, the Washington State legislature <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5933&Year=2021">passed a bill</a> establishing the <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/sites/default/files/public/communications/2022docs/C9-School-Seismic-Safety-Grant-Program.pdf">School Seismic Safety program</a> to provide planning and construction funds for K-12 public schools to retrofit or relocate their buildings for better protection against earthquakes and tsunamis. The program is expected to provide $500 million to schools via grant applications from 2023-2033. However, the SSSP final report estimates that upgrading all public schools would cost billions of dollars.

                <br>
                <p>In June 2021, the SSSP final report called for the creation of a statewide inventory of school districts to collect data about which facilities have had seismic upgrades. Two years later, that effort is well underway. A public records request to the <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/">Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI)</a> yielded a 6,503 row spreadsheet representing individual "building areas" at 1,992 public school sites. Fields include year built, construction type, retrofit status, soil type, risk level, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-liquefaction#:~:text=Liquefaction%20takes%20place%20when%20loosely,cause%20major%20damage%20during%20earthquakes.">liquefaction</a>, and more. Preliminary calculations show around 200 schools rated "very high" risk, and around 70 schools rated "high" risk. In my local district, none of the seven “very high" or “high" risk schools have been retrofitted, although several others were recently rebuilt. In addition, the risk level has not yet been added for more than 60 percent of the listed schools. 
                </p>
                <p>As this data collection is ongoing, there are fields with missing data, as well as historial (outdated) data for buildings that have since been replaced. (Seventeen school listings marked "old" were excluded from the analysis). While OSPI has been responsive to my requests, this static version of the dataset will soon become outdated, with no public version currently available to check for updates. Facility data is not included in the <a href="https://washingtonstatereportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/">Washington School Report Card</a>, which is often used to research individual public schools, with information about enrollment, teacher qualifications, student performance, expenditures per student, and more. (It is also unclear why some of the schools in my district are listed as “rural” in the OSPI data when they are located in a city).
                </p>
                <h3>Unreinforced Masonry Buildings</h3>
                <p>The SSSP final report notes that buildings made with unreinforced masonry (URM) before the 1940s, and non-ductile concrete buildings (without seismic upgrades) constructed before the mid-1970s, face the highest risk of collapse in an earthquake. Secondarily, the report notes that buildings constructed prior to 1975 out of reinforced masonry and wood frame materials are also vulnerable to collapse.
                </p>
                <p>Although the dangers posed by URM buildings in an earthquake are well known, identifying these buildings with precision remains challenging. Buildings constructed with unreinforced masonry may be identified via an observable <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/hazards/unreinforced-masonry-buildings-(urm)-">brick pattern</a> with a narrow brick width every 5-6 rows, and by low or flat arched windows, historical records, and on-site assessments. The buildings are usually <a href="https://www.commerce.wa.gov/programs/research-services/unreinforced-masonry-building-inventory/">constructed</a> with red bricks, or sometimes clay tiles. However, there are numerous “suspected” rather than confirmed URMs due to the complex identification process.
                </p>
                <p>In 2018, the Washington State legislature <a href="https://www.ofm.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/budget/statebudget/18supp/capital/2018suppCapAgencyDetail.pdf">allocated</a> $200,000 for the Department of Commerce to create an inventory of URM buildings in the state. According to the <a href="https://www.commerce.wa.gov/programs/research-services/unreinforced-masonry-building-inventory/">announcement</a>, the study identified 1,176 confirmed URM buildings, including 219 school facilities, both public and private (although a PDF document linked via the word <a href="https://deptofcommerce.app.box.com/v/wa-urm-schools">"Schools"</a> notes 76 identified URMs and 143 “identified or suspected" URMs). The  <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/com/urmasonary/urmasonary/#7/47.347/-121.029/">Washington URM Dashboard</a> currently shows 34 public schools and 41 private schools, largely concentrated around the Seattle area. Some of the schools do not have their names listed. (The original <a href="http://www.gartrellgroup.net/WashURMViewer/#7/47.347/-121.029/">database link</a> provided in media coverage when the dashboard was published no longer works).

                </p>
                <p>Looking at the OSPI data shows three construction types that include some type of URM: <i>URM bearing walls</i>, and concrete or steel frames with <i>URM infill walls</i>. There are about 168 public schools listed as having one of these URM construction types in at least one section of their current campuses, and about 25 of those schools have been seismically retroftted. 
                </p>

                  </div>
                <br>
                <p>My local elementary school has a “very high” risk rating in the OSPI data, with two out of six building areas having “concrete frame buildings with URM infill walls”. This marks an increase from the school’s “high” risk listed in the district's Pre-Hazard Mitigation Plan. Five of the six building areas are labeled as the “main area” of the “main building,” without differentiation. Are these common areas or classrooms? Which grades are affected? I drive over to look for the characteristic brick pattern that can be used to identify URM buildings. I don’t see it. Phew. I snap some pictures. I drive home. Then I look more closely. I think I do see it. My local school is not among the 34 public schools in the Washington URM Dashboard, but the dashboard also carries a disclaimer that says, "The presence or absence of a building or data contained herein does not mean the structure is or is not a URM."
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In the coming weeks, I plan to further investigate these issues and seek answers to some of the areas of confusion noted above. For more information on this project, visit the <a href="https://github.com/efkodon/schools_data_access">Github repository</a>.
