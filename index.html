                <p><strong>By Emily Keller-O'Donnell</strong></p>
                <p class="date">July 25, 2023</p>
                <p> As the start of the 2023-2024 school year approaches, understanding the seismic risk level of K-12 schools in earthquake-prone Washington State is a complex challenge. There are multiple state initiatives underway to improve tracking and fund construction and renovation at high risk schools, but the data can be difficult to access and complicated to interpret.</p>
                <h3><strong>Statewide Efforts to Improve Data Collection and Upgrade Buildings</strong></h3>
                <p>
                From 2017-2021, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources led the <a href="https://www.dnr.wa.gov/school-seismic-safety">School Seismic Safety Project (SSSP)</a>, with $3.4 million in state funding, to conduct geological and engineering assessments of 561 public school buildings at 274 schools. The <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dnr/geologydata/school_seismic_safety/phase2/School_Seismic_Safety_Project_2021_Final_Report_DNR.pdf">final report</a> identified more than 80 "very high" risk buildings and more than 270 "high" risk buildings. The assessments represent about 14 percent of the state's more than 4,000 public school buildings for grades K-12.
                </p>
                In 2022, the Washington State legislature <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5933&Year=2021">passed a bill</a> establishing the <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/sites/default/files/public/communications/2022docs/C9-School-Seismic-Safety-Grant-Program.pdf">School Seismic Safety program</a> to provide planning and construction funds for K-12 public schools to retrofit or relocate their buildings for better protection against earthquakes and tsunamis. The program is expected to provide $500 million to schools via grant applications from 2023-2033. However, the SSSP final report estimates that upgrading all public schools would cost billions of dollars.

                <br>
                <p>In June 2021, the SSSP final report called for a statewide inventory of school districts to collect data about which facilities have had prior seismic upgrades. Two years later, data collection continues. A public records request to the <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/">Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI)</a> yielded a 6,503 row spreadsheet representing individual "building areas" at 1,992 public schools. Fields include year built, construction type, retrofit status, soil type, risk level and <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-liquefaction#:~:text=Liquefaction%20takes%20place%20when%20loosely,cause%20major%20damage%20during%20earthquakes.">liquefaction</a>, which occurs when soft soils cause increased ground shaking. The list includes 205 "very high" risk schools, and 73 "high" risk schools. The campus-wide risk level has not yet been added for more than 65 percent of listed schools. 
                </p>
                <p>As this data collection is ongoing, there are fields with missing data, as well as outdated data for buildings that have since been replaced. (Seventeen schools that were marked as "old" were excluded from this analysis). Facility data is not included in the <a href="https://washingtonstatereportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/">Washington School Report Card</a>, which provides information about individual public schools, such as enrollment, teacher qualifications, student performance and expenditures per student. 
                </p>
                <h3>Unreinforced Masonry Buildings</h3>
                <p>The SSSP final report notes that buildings made with unreinforced masonry (URM) before the 1940s, and non-ductile concrete buildings (without seismic upgrades) constructed before the mid-1970s, face the highest risk of collapse in an earthquake. Secondarily, the report notes that buildings constructed prior to 1975 out of reinforced masonry and wood frame materials are also vulnerable to collapse.
                </p>
                <p>Although the dangers posed by URM buildings in an earthquake are well known, identifying these buildings with precision remains challenging. Buildings constructed with unreinforced masonry may be identified via an observable <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/hazards/unreinforced-masonry-buildings-(urm)-">brick pattern</a> with a narrow brick width every 5-6 rows, and by low or flat arched windows, historical records or on-site assessments. The buildings are usually <a href="https://www.commerce.wa.gov/programs/research-services/unreinforced-masonry-building-inventory/">constructed</a> with red bricks, or sometimes clay tiles. However, there are numerous “suspected” rather than confirmed URMs due to the complex identification process.

                </p>
                <p>In 2018, the Washington State legislature <a href="https://www.ofm.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/budget/statebudget/18supp/capital/2018suppCapAgencyDetail.pdf">allocated</a> $200,000 for the Department of Commerce to create an inventory of URM buildings. According to the <a href="https://www.commerce.wa.gov/programs/research-services/unreinforced-masonry-building-inventory/">announcement</a>, the study identified 1,176 confirmed URM buildings, including 219 school facilities, both public and private (although a PDF document linked via the word <a href="https://deptofcommerce.app.box.com/v/wa-urm-schools">"Schools"</a> notes 76 identified URMs and 143 “identified or suspected" URMs). The  <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/com/urmasonary/urmasonary/#7/47.347/-121.029/">Washington URM Dashboard</a> currently shows 34 public schools and 41 private schools, largely concentrated around the Seattle area. Some of the schools do not have their names listed. (The original <a href="http://www.gartrellgroup.net/WashURMViewer/#7/47.347/-121.029/">database link</a> provided in media coverage when the dashboard was published no longer works). </p>
                <p>Looking at the OSPI data obtained via public records request shows three construction types that include some type of URM: <i>URM bearing walls</i>, concrete frames with  <i>URM infill walls</i>, and steel frames with <i>URM infill walls</i>. There are about 168 public schools listed as having one of these URM construction types in at least one section of their current campuses, and about 25 of those schools are marked as having been seismically retroftted. 
                </p>

                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>With this information, understanding seismic risks at specific buildings remains challenging. For example, the school shown above has a “very high” risk rating in the OSPI database, with two out of six building areas having “concrete frame buildings with URM infill walls”. But the building area names, all of which are identified as the "main area" in the "main building," make it hard to differentiate the high risk sections. The observable brick walls do not appear to have the characteristic pattern that is often used to identify URM construction. The school is also not included in the list of 34 public schools in the Washington URM Dashboard, although the dashboard also carries the disclaimer, "The presence or absence of a building or data contained herein does not mean the structure is or is not a URM."</p>
