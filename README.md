                <h1 class="title">The Search for Information about the Earthquake Readiness of Washington State Schools</h1>
                <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
                <p> I created this project as a student in The Lede Program at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. My goal was to explore a dataset from the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) that contained more than 6,500 rows of data about structural and seismic information at school buildings. I received the data by submitting a public records request for a database that was described in the <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dnr/geologydata/school_seismic_safety/phase2/School_Seismic_Safety_Project_2021_Final_Report_DNR.pdf">School Seismic Safety Project (SSSP) 2019â€“2021 Legislative Report</a>.

                <h2 class="title">Skills Learned</h2>
                <p>To create this project, I developed skills in merging, cleaning, structuring and sorting data using pandas. To gather a greater breadth of data about the schools, I combined the OSPI data with a list of 2,552 schools from the <a href="https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/23bbd746f9924c149681815cfd2a6300/explore?location=47.266088%2C-120.802250%2C7.02&showTabl">Washington Geospatial Open Data Portal</a>. Spot-checking the merged data showed inconsistencies, indicating that the matching process was ultimately unsuccessful and will need to be redone. I also used pandas to parse the data into smaller dataframes and lists for analysis, based on construction type, risk ratings and school districts.
                </p>
                <h2 class="title">Future Work</h2>
                <p>To further develop this project, I want to write a web scraper to create a database of the school buildings that are listed in the 
                <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/com/urmasonary/urmasonary/#7/47.347/-121.029/">Washington URM Dashboard</a>, which provides a map of buildings across the state that have a particularly dangerous construction type that presents a high risk of collapse in an earthquake. I also want to parse the OSPI data further to look for trends across geographies, construction types, and risk factors.
